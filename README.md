# Weather-Data-Access---Open-Weather-API-
Weather Data Access In Python


The weblink from where the weather data is accessed is - http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?

Create an API key which is automatically generated when you sign up into the website.
This weather data could be used for many applications like predictive analysis of rain,climate....

I have used to access the weather data of Chennai,TamilNadu.


Two libraries are used: 1. Requests - pip install requests
                        2.json - already exists in python
